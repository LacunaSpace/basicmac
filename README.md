# Basic MAC

Basic MAC is a portable implementation of the LoRa™ Alliance's LoRaWAN™
specification in the C programming language. It is a fork of IBM's LMiC
library, and supports multiple regions, which are selectable at compile and/or
run time. It can handle Class A, Class B, and Class C devices.

#### Release 2.2

This is the final official release of the stack, as Semtech is ending support
for LoRa Basics™ MAC. For new designs, we recommend using LoRaMAC-Node.
